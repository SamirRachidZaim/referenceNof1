Description: The referenceNof1 is an R package to further enable precision medicine in single-subject studies. 
    Given the disagreements that may occur in methods of differential gene expression, we propose a new algorithm, *referenceNof1*, to systematically identify regions in the transcriptome that maximize concordance across techniques to maximize biological signal and minimize statisitcal noise. These tools are developed in single-subject paired design studies, that use fold change and expression-level filters to conduct a grid search to identify the optimal parameters for constructing an optimal reference standard.
